# Connect to bb8:
	When you have to define you bb8, in some websites you will see that you have to put the bb8 MAC, 
	 	bb8 = sphero("F3:F2:6D:55:71:09");
	but it doesn't work. Instead of, put the bb8 id. You will find it using this script, 
		node ./node_modules/noble/examples/advertisement-discovery.js
	This id is similar to : 22bb746f2ba075542d6f726568705327;
